My preferred medium of communication is Slack direct message. I'm active on two Slack organizations: [UW DUB](https://uwdub.slack.com/) and [Computing Edu & UW](https://computinged-uw.slack.com). 

If you're not part of those Slack organizations, please reach out to me by email or on Twitter. 

~~My lab is in [Mary Gates Hall (MGH)](https://www.washington.edu/maps/?mgh) 015.~~ I'm working remotely. Catch you on Zoom!
