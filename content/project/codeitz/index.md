Online learning experiences often don't provide the guidance to help learners make decisions about what to learn next or don't let learners decide for themselves, instead forcing a learner to follow a path they didn't choose for themselves. We designed three variations of Codeitz to explore the effects of varying information provided and agency afforded to learners on their experience and learning.

This work helps inform how to design self-directed online learning tools such that learners can take ownership of their learning experience without ever feeling lost or overburdened.
