Students face challenges that are often invisible to their instructors or even themselves! This project investigates how to use student feedback to identify challenges faced by the most underserved learners in computing courses. We are designing and developing ways to interact and use AI tools to address rather than exacerbate equity issues in the complex domain of education. 

By developing tools that enable students to effortlessly and privately share their course experiences and empower both students and instructors to interpret and use this information to take action, we can better serve under-represented learners in computing courses.

This work is in collaboration with the [UW College of Education](https://education.uw.edu/) and [UW Office for the Advancement of Engineering Teaching & Learning](https://www.engr.washington.edu/mycoe/oaetl).
